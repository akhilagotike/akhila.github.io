        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            Nuclear energy is one of the most powerful and efficient sources of electricity today. It provides low-carbon energy 
            but also presents challenges such as radioactive waste and safety concerns. This paper explores the history, 
            working principles, advantages, challenges, and future innovations of nuclear energy.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Nuclear energy is generated through nuclear fission, where the nucleus of an atom is split, releasing a tremendous amount of energy. 
            This energy is harnessed in nuclear power plants to generate electricity.
        </p>

        <h2>2. History of Nuclear Energy</h2>
        <p>
            The development of nuclear energy began in the early 20th century with the discovery of radioactivity by Henri Becquerel 
            and further research by Marie Curie. The first controlled nuclear chain reaction was achieved in 1942 by Enrico Fermi.
        </p>

        <h2>3. How Nuclear Energy Works</h2>
        <h3>3.1 Nuclear Fission</h3>
        <p>
            Nuclear fission occurs when a heavy atomic nucleus, such as uranium-235 or plutonium-239, absorbs a neutron and splits into 
            two smaller nuclei, releasing a large amount of energy in the form of heat.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 Nuclear Reactors</h3>
        <p>
            A nuclear power plant contains a reactor where fission occurs. The heat produced is used to convert water into steam, 
            which spins turbines connected to a generator, producing electricity.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Applications of Nuclear Energy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Electricity Generation:</strong> Used in over 30 countries, providing about 10% of global electricity.</li>
            <li><strong>Medical Applications:</strong> Nuclear medicine uses radioactive isotopes for imaging and cancer treatment.</li>
            <li><strong>Space Exploration:</strong> Radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) power space probes like Voyager and Curiosity.</li>
            <li><strong>Industrial Uses:</strong> Nuclear technology is used in agriculture, food preservation, and desalination.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Advantages of Nuclear Energy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Low Greenhouse Gas Emissions:</strong> Unlike fossil fuels, nuclear plants produce minimal COâ‚‚ emissions.</li>
            <li><strong>High Energy Density:</strong> A small amount of uranium produces enormous energy compared to coal or gas.</li>
            <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Nuclear plants operate continuously, unlike solar and wind energy.</li>
            <li><strong>Reduction in Fossil Fuel Dependence:</strong> Helps reduce reliance on oil and coal for energy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <h3>Stylistic Choices</h3>
        <p>
            I chose "Georgia" as the font for body text to enhance readability while maintaining a professional look. For the background, 
            I used a light grayish-blue color (`#f8f9fa`) to make the text easier to read without harsh contrast.
        </p>
        <p>
            The headings use a clear size hierarchy: `<h1>` is 36px, `<h2>` is 28px, and `<h3>` is 22px. This makes sections visually distinct.
        </p>
        <p>
            The header and footer have a dark blue (`#004080`) background with white text to create a strong visual impact. 
            I used padding and margins throughout the page to improve spacing and readability.
        </p>

        <h3>HTML Abuse Corrections</h3>
        <p>
            Previously, I had used `<h2>` for the main title because it "looked good," but it should be `<h1>` as it is the highest-level heading. 
            I also replaced `<b>` tags with `<strong>` for better semantic meaning and accessibility.

    <script type="text/javascript">
        var x = new Date(document.lastModified).toLocaleDateString();
        document.getElementById('lastModified').textContent = x;
